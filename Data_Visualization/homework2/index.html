			1. Visualization Design (30/100)</br>
In this part, you will find a bad design of a visualization work (e.g. chart, figure, graph, etc.) from</br>
internet. Please use the principles, theories, and tips we learned from the class to analyze this work.</br>
Make sure the lie factor, data-ink ratio, and Tufteâ€™s principles are all used in your analysis for the</br>
minimum requirements. Please suggest your new design to improve this work and show your
results by any tools </br>(e.g. Excel, Photoshop, Matlab, Power Point, Illustrator, etc.), or, draw by hand
and take a photo or scan.</br>

		Anlysis:</br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		As PPT said "Excellence in statistical graphics consists of
		complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficinecy."</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		First, the sum of percentage in this pircture is 270%. which do not make sense ro audio at first time.</br>
		I know this is talking about people memory, so why made a pyramid? it will confuse audio.</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Second, Color choose, I do not understand why the author chose blue from light to dark.</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Third, Data Ink = ink to show data = Data-ink/total ink.</br></br>
		In this picture I think that background, shadow and color of pyramid are all redundant.</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Fourth, Lie factor, in my view, the height of each block seems to be the same.</br>
		if the height is the same, ratio of volume is </br>
		(1^3):(2^3-1):(3^3-2^3):(4^3-3^3):(5^3-4^3):(6^3-5^3)</br>
		=1:7:19:37:61:91</br>
		so the size of effect in graphic is 6, 1.7, 0.95, 0.65, 0.49
		the ratio of data is 1:2:3:5:7:9 </br>
		ths size of effect in data is 1, 0.5, 0.66, 0.4, 0.29</br>
		So the Lie factor is 6:3.4:1.44:1.625:1.69</br>
		the largest one is 6 which is much more bigger than 1.05;</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Fifth, this pyramid is too big. take woo much space which is against tufte priciple</br>

			2. Dimensionality Reduction (20/100)
In this part, you will draw the first eigenvector (principle component) of Principle Components</br>
Analysis (PCA) result or Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) result. Different colors represent</br>
different data distributions (with different labels).</br>

			a,b,c: "PCA finds the largest variations directions of the underlying data"</br>
			For c I am not sure which line has largest variations. Both can be the largest one.</br>
			But on picture it seems that the horizontal one a little larger</br>
			d,e,f: "LDA is to maximize between scaEers and minimize within scaEers"
			for f, I can not find a direction which has no overlap when project the dots on this line. So I have to choose the most reasonable one.

			3. Color (30/100)
In this part, you are given an RGB color as [137, 56, 146] with R,G,B values in [0, 255]. Please scale</br>
the values to [0, 1] and calculate the corresponding color values in the CIE XYZ, CIE xyY, CMYK, HSV,</br>
and HSL spaces respectively. Please provide an image at arbitrary size to show this color. You can</br>
use any source codes, software, tools, or online demos to finish this part. But, you have to point out</br>
all the resources you have used.</br>
Hint: http://www.easyrgb.com/index.php?X=MATH or http://en.wikipedia.org is good reference</br>

			4. Visual Perception and Cognition (20/100)</br>
		In this part, please answer the questions from the view of visual perception and cognition. What you
		can tell from the following two figures? What is the similar part and what is the difference? Why this
		can happen? 
		</a>
		</div>
		<img src="question4.jpg" alt="question4_image" style="width:80%;height:400;">

			<a>
				1.What you can tell from the following two figures?</br>
				</br>
				In left one there are letter A B C.</br>
				In right one there are number 12 13 14.</br>
				</br>
				2.What is the similar part and what is the difference</br>
				</br>
				Both picture are the same at the mid. But they are different at sides
				</br></br>
				3.Why this can happen? </br>
				</br>
				"Viewers want to see something, so they're expecting to see it"</br>
				Since in the left one, we can tell A and C so we are expecting to see B</br>
				The same to right one. We can tell 12 and 14. Our brain is expecting to see 13.
